# 2016 - Geospatial data access via standard web services | Tutorial
This tutorial is a series of IPython Notebooks that provides (i) a general introduction to web standards for geospatial data and (ii) practical hands-on exercises how to access, retrieve and process data served with a WCS server. 

After working through the tutorial, you should have a clearer idea of: 
* OGC standards for geospatial data in general,
* the purpose and importance of the WCS and WCPS standards, 
* how data can be accessed, processed and retrieved with the help of a WC(P)S, and 
* how WC(P)S requests can easily be integrated into processing routines or used to build custom web-applications.

### NOTE: <br>
The service the examples are based on was switched off. The examples help you anyway to see how OGC web service requests are built and can be used as part of the geospatial data analysis workflow.
